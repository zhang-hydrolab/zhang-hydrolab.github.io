His research primarily focuses on the eco-hydrological effects of climate change and human activities, exploring how anthropogenic disturbances—such as artificial vegetation restoration, natural vegetation growth, land-use changes, mining and check dam—influence watershed hydrology, ecosystem, and water resource sustainability. Through a multidisciplinary approach integrating field observations, remote sensing, hydrological modeling and land model. His work has been published in journals like Journal of Hydrology, ERL, JGR-Biogeo, LDD, JEMA, Ecological Indicators and Ecological Engineering, etc. | eco-hydrological effects of human activities | https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jinkai-Luan-2/research  | [luanjk@nuist.edu.cn](http://luanjk@nuist.edu.cn)            |
