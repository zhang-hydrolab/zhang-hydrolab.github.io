| ![Francis Chiew](D:\Onedrive\GitHub\zhangyqlab\colabration\Francis Chiew.png) | **Francis Chiew** has 30 years of experience in research, teaching and consulting, and in science leadership and people and project management. Francis joined CSIRO as a Science Leader in Canberra in 2006, after a 15-year academic career at the University of Melbourne. In the past ten years, Francis has led 30-40 hydrologists working on water resources assessment, hydrological forecasting and prediction, climate change adaptation, and integrated basin management, in projects totalling more than AUD$10m per year. | CSIRO                                 |
| ![Tim McVicar](D:\Onedrive\GitHub\zhangyqlab\colabration\Tim McVicar.webp) | **Tim McVicar** is a Research Scientist who leads the *Biophysical Dynamics Team* in the *Living Landscapes Program* of CSIRO Environment. With over 35 years of experience in ecohydrology, climatology, remote sensing, and spatial interpolation, he develops high-resolution estimates of actual evapotranspiration across Australia using satellite imagery. His research focuses on modelling AET, monitoring vegetation dynamics, assessing drought and climate variability, and understanding surface-energy exchanges through satellite–meteorological data integration. | CSIRO                                 |
| ![Amir AghaKouchak](D:\Onedrive\GitHub\zhangyqlab\colabration\Amir AghaKouchak.webp) | **Amir AghaKouchak** is a Chancellor’s Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Director of the *Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (CHRS)* at the University of California, Irvine. His research bridges hydrology, climatology, and remote sensing, focusing on natural hazards, climate extremes, and compound and cascading events. He has authored over 270 peer-reviewed papers and received major honors including the AGU James B. Macelwane Medal, AGU, ASCE, and EWRI Fellowships, ASCE Norman Medal, AMS Robert E. Horton Lectureship in Hydrology, and the ASCE Huber Research Prize. | University of California, Irvine      |
