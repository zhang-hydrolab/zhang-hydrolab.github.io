# **水循环和生态水文： Understanding the Changing Global Water Cycle**

The team investigates how global warming and human activities are altering fundamental water cycle processes. They seek to reconcile different data sources (like satellite, model (such as PML-V2 evapotranspiration and HBV-PML hydrological models), and ground observations) to better quantify these changes, asking critical questions such as why parts of the water cycle appear to be stagnating despite warming, and how human actions reshape water availability and ecosystem functions—like the roles of forests as “sponges” or “pumps”—at regional and global scales.

This innovative model integrates the remote sensing evapotranspiration model PML with the classical hydrological model HBV, significantly improving the accuracy of evapotranspiration simulation through remote sensing observations.

# **水灾害和水安全 Water-Related Disasters and Security Under Climate Change**

This theme focuses on the mechanisms and impacts of extreme hydrological events, including droughts and floods. The group studies how droughts develop and propagate through different environmental layers, how flood patterns have evolved in China over decades, and how to enhance societal and ecological resilience to water-related extremes in a changing climate.

| Forest fire & flood ecological-hydrological effects | ![flood](D:\Onedrive\GitHub\zhangyqlab\Research\flood.png) | The research explores the impacts of bushfires on hydrological processes in southeast Australia, particularly focusing on changes in water balance and flood magnitudes. One study examines the effects of the 2009 Victorian Bushfires on water balance in eight forested catchments, finding a reduction in evapotranspiration and an increase in streamflow, leading to a long-term decline in water storage in burned areas. Another study investigates the 2019-2020 mega forest fires, showing that these fires significantly amplified flood magnitudes, especially in regions with winter-dominated rainfall. | [1] Xu, Z., Zhang, Y., Zhang, X., Ma, N., Tian, J., Kong, D., & Post, D.

By integrating meteorological and hydrological features like temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration, the model effectively fills the 11-month data gap, showing superior accuracy, particularly in arid regions. The transformer-based approach outperforms traditional methods, demonstrating the potential of AI in enhancing satellite data continuity and reliability for environmental monitoring. | [1] Wang, L., & Zhang, Y.

| CAS-Canglong              | ![CAS-Canglong](D:\Onedrive\GitHub\zhangyqlab\Research\CAS-Canglong.png) | We present a novel AI-based approach for sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) global sea surface temperature (SST) prediction, using a 3D Transformer model called CAS-Canglong. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism inherent in Transformer architectures, the model efficiently handles the complexities of ocean-atmosphere interactions and improves prediction accuracy. Compared to traditional physics-based models, CAS-Canglong demonstrates superior skill in predicting SST patterns, enhancing computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy for up to three months in advance. This approach shows great potential for improving predictions of extreme weather events like droughts and floods, as well as for future climate studies. | [1] Wang, L., Zhang, X., Leung, L.
